# My processes and suppliers

I design [printed circuit boards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board)
 using [KiCad](https://kicad.org/)
[computer aided design (CAD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design) open source software.

[OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/) makes inexpensive PCBs.
OSH means [open source hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware)

[OSHStencils](https://www.oshstencils.com/#%20) makes stencils to silkscreen solder paste onto the boards.

[Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/) distributes electronic components.
Mouser and Jameco also do.

I get small quantities of surplus or salvaged motors from eBay and Alibaba.
Small motors are expensive or hard to find,  especially new or brushless motors.
The manufacturers want to sell a minimum of a thousand.
But there is a huge surplus of "pager" motors used to vibrate cell phones.

I place [surface mount devices (SMD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology)
components onto a PCB using a hypodermic needle with a tube to my mouth.
Some people use tweezers or a hand held, vacuum tool.

Then I reflow the boards in a toaster oven.

The rest of the assembly process is by hand, often using jeweler's tools and a magnifying glass.

For chimes, I often buy a wind chime and reuse the ringing parts.
