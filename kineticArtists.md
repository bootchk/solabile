Artists who have made kinetic art.

See [Selected kinetic sculptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_art#Selected_kinetic_sculptors) at Wikipedia.
Here I link to a few more kinetic artists and summarize their contributions.

This excludes artists who made hanging sculpture that either just twisted,
or symbolized things that could move.

[Marcel Duchamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel Duchamp)
whose "readymade" ["Bicycle Wheel, 1913"](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/81631) would move if you spun it.)
And whose ["Rotary demisphere, 1925"](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/81432) used motors and optical effects.

[Naum Gabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naum_Gabo) 
whose ["Standing Wave, 1920"](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gabo-kinetic-construction-standing-wave-t00827) may be the first kinetic sculpture.

[Man Ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Ray) 
whose ["Obstruction, 1920"](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/680681) is a mobile of coat hangers.

[Dale Eldred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Eldred) Virtually kinetic via optical effects.

Joseph Burlini whose [Rainbow Machine, 1993](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Machine) has both motion and virtual, holographic effects.

## Contemporary artists

[Marco Mahler](https://www.marcomahler.com/) makes mobiles, including 3D printed mobiles.
Whose 3D printed mobiles were at "The Mobile Show" at the Carrack Gallery, along with my mobiles.

[Ned Kahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_Kahn) Walls of fluttering tiles.

[Sarah Sze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Sze)
whose ["Shorter than the Day, 2020"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorter_than_the_Day) I imagine flutters.
