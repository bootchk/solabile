Artists who have made kinetic art.

Mostly links to Wikipedia.

This excludes artists who made hanging sculpture that either just twisted,
or symbolized things that could move.

[Naum Gabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naum_Gabo) whose [Standing Wave, 1920](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gabo-kinetic-construction-standing-wave-t00827) may be the first kinetic sculpture.

[Man Ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_Ray)

[Marcel Duchamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel Duchamp) whose "readymade" bicycle wheel would move if you spun it.

[Ned Kahn] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_Kahn)

[Dale Eldred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Eldred) Virtually kinetic via optical effects.
