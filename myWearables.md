## Solar Earring

The first solar earring I made, circa TODO.

Hard to align and solder the solar cells.

Four TEMD solar cells in series, producing.

## Solar Earring II

Next version, circa TODO.

Easier to make because the solar cells are SMD and could be reflow soldered
(except I don't, since there are components on both sides.
You could glue the solar cells onto the pasted pads, and then reflow.)

Since only three cells in series, produces less voltage.

Since all solar cells are in the same plane 
so often none are shaded.
Thus, loosely speaking, it requires the same light as the first earring.
