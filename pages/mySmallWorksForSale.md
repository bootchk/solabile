--- 

I make and sell some of my solar-powered mobiles and chimes.

Here you can see them all, compare and choose.

I make them by hand in my small studio.
Using components from around the world.
Since made by hand, products are subject to small variations.

They are for sale at Tindie, Etsy, and Amazon Handmade.
Search for "Solabile" or the name of the product.

All are for indoor use.
All work in average indoor artifical light or in a sunny room.
Some require even less light.

They all require some light but not *too* much light.
You must choose a good place to hang them.
Some will withstand direct sunlight, some won't.

For details, see the product listings in the stores.

## Solar Indoor Butterfly Chime

Like a Furin wind chime, but powered by light.

Hang it under an overhead light, and then it chimes when the light is on.

Or hang it in carefully selected locations near a window.  Solar cell faces up, do not install where sunlight hits it.

## Solar Indoor Low Light Chime

A bird spinning in flowers.

Hang it in a sunny room.
Requires less light than the {{ page.sibc }} since the solar cell is larger.
The solar cell faces down so it can withstand direct sunlight.

## Solar Indoor Cat Chime
A cat with an undecorated clapper.

Like the {{ page.sibc }}.
Best installed under a ceiling light since the solar cell faces up.

I don't make the glass bells, they are from China.
This one is molded glass, not blown, so the sound is a little duller.

## Solar Desktop Gong

A solar-powered gong in an acrylic stand, to sit on a desktop or shelf.

Like the {{ page.sibc }} it is best installed under a ceiling light since the solar cell faces up.

The gong is a repurposed hard drive platter.
It clanks and doesn't sound like a gong.

This is like the units used in my stacked work "Bell Pagoda".
But improved.

## Solar Tubular Chime
A solar-powered tubular chime to hang in a sunny place.

Like the Solar Indoor Low Light Chime, the solar cell is larger and faces down,
so it can withstand direct sunlight.

The aluminum tube is only about eight inches, not long enough to have a deep, resonant sound

## Solar Propeller Mobile

A solar-powered, propeller driven mobile.

Every few minutes, a short pulse of the propeller spins the mobile for about one revolution.
Depending on the light.

One of my few mobiles not hung from the shaft of the motor.
Invented long ago by someone else.

The solar cell is a film solar cell.
It is large because a propeller is inefficient.

You can rotate the hanger so that the solar cell faces up or down.
The solar cell should not receive direct sunlight.
