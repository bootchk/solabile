Artists who have used solar panels or other photovoltaic devices,
tightly integrated into the work.

Excludes kinetic works which are powered by solar panels sitting to the side

This page is a work in progress, please send me additional links.

### Artists who used solar panels (light-to-electricity photovolatic devices)

[Patrice Stellest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Stellest) "Solar Head", 1997: A sculpture that incorporated solar panels to blink lights.

[Sarah Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Hall_(glass_artist)) Artful but functioning solar panels (generating electricity.)



### Artists who used LED's (electricity-to-light photovolatic devices) powered unconventionally

[Brigitte Hitschler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigitte_Hitschler) "Energy Field", 1999.  Cathodes and anodes in a potash slag heap formed an
[electric battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery)
that power LED's on stalks above the ground.
