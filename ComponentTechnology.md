# Components I use in Solabiles

This about the manufacturers of electronic and other parts.

I try not to use special, hard-to-find, unobtainable parts.
They are available retail or on-line.

## Solar Cells

I often use glass, indoor solar cells from [Panasonic Amorton.](https://panasonic.co.jp/ls/psam/en/products/pdf/Catalog_Amorton_ENG.pdf)
These are the same as you find in solar calculators.
They are intended for indoor light.

I also use film solar cells from [Powerfilm.]
Most of them are intended for outdoor, sunlight.
But they recently added models such as LL3-37 which are better in indoor light.

## Motors

For my small works, I use pager motors.
They are inexpensive, and readily available.
They are inexpensive because they make billions of them for the vibrators in cell phones.
They are brushed DC motors that operate down to one volt and a hundred milliamps.

Brushed motors require no special circuitry to drive them.
That is, supply is either on or off.

I have started to use brushless motors.
They usually require driver chips to operate them.
But they should be have a much longer life than brushed motors.

## Stainless

## Carbon fiber tubes
