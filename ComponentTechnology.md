# Components I use in Solabiles

This about the manufacturers of electronic and other parts.

I use mass-produced parts that are available retail or on-line.
I try not to use special, hard-to-find, unobtainable parts.

## Solar Cells

I often use glass, indoor solar cells from [Panasonic Amorton.](https://panasonic.co.jp/ls/psam/en/products/pdf/Catalog_Amorton_ENG.pdf)
These are the same as used in solar calculators.
They are intended for indoor light.

I also use film solar cells from [Powerfilm](https://www.powerfilmsolar.com/) that are printed on rollers.
Most of them are intended for outdoor, sunlight.
But they recently added models such as LL3-37 which are better in indoor light.

Both are readily available from Digikey.

## Motors

For my small works, I use pager motors.
They are inexpensive, and readily available.
They are inexpensive because billions are used to vibrate in phones.
They are [brushed DC motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushed_DC_electric_motor)
that operate down to one volt and a hundred milliamps.

Brushed motors require no special circuitry to drive them.
That is, the power is either on or off.

I sometimes use [brushless (BLDC) motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushless_DC_electric_motor).
They usually require driver chips to operate them.
But they have an expected lifetime longer than that of brushed motors.

Some motors used in flying drones are brushless and inexpensive, from China.

[Faulhaber](https://www.faulhaber.com/en/home/),
[Maxon](https://www.maxongroup.com/maxon/view/content/index),
and [Nidec](https://www.nidec.com/en/)
make brushless motors.

## Integrated circuits

I often used IC's from [Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com/)

Solar energy harvesters.

Motor drivers or [controllers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_controller).

Voltage monitors.

Load switches.

## Capacitors

I don't use batteries, only capacitors, 
which have a much longer lifetime (many decades)
and are not a chemical or fire hazard.

When I need a small capacitor, I use [tantalum capacitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantalum_capacitor).
They have a high density (high volumetric capacitance.)

When I need more capacitance (say for a large motor) I use [super capacitors.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercapacitor)

For the application of ultra-low solar-power,
the leakage of the capacitor dominates the [leakage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leakage_(electronics))
of other components such as switches.
The capacitors must be "low leakage."

For the application of driving motors,
the capacitors must provide a high current pulse.
The capacitors must be low [ESR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalent_series_resistance).
