A classification of art into categories, by physics.
To explain where solar mobiles fit.
There are other ways to classify art.
This classification emphasizes motion/dynamics/kinetics.




2D

- static (traditional paintings/drawings)
- dynamic
    - [video art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_art): show motion on a 2D screen

    - virtual: seems to move

        - [optical art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op_art) by [op artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Op_art)
        - [autostereogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram)
a seeming 3D image pops out if you unfocus your eyes correctly
        - [lenticular printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_printing) 
image changes as viewer moves
        - [iridescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence) 
Color changes as viewer or lighting moves


3D

- static 
    - without motion (traditional sculpture)
    - [Renewable energy sculpture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_sculpture) (decorated power generators)

- kinetic (something moves)
    - performance art (the performers move)
    - [land art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_art) (environment/lighting moves over time) by [land artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Land_artists)
    - [environmental art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_art)
    - [iridescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence) as viewer moves [Dale Eldred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Eldred)
    - [light show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_show) (drones, lasers, beams)
    - wind driven
        - stationary (work stays in same location)
            - Calder [mobiles](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mobile#Derived_terms) 
and [stabiles](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stabile#English)
        - nonstationary (moves from one location to another)
    - motorized
        - stationary
            - grid or battery powered
            - solar powered   "solabile"
        - moveable, motive, transporting

A classification (a tree) whose leave are usually links to Wikipedia.

The relations between categories of art is more generally a graph.
This is a spanning tree of that graph.
There are other ways to classify, i.e. choose a spanning tree.
This choice of spanning tree emphasizes the physics: what moves and what doesn't.
