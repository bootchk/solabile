### About me

I create solar-powered [kinetic art.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_art)
Mainly [Calder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Calder) mobiles
and [wind chimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_chime)
powered by light and motors.
But you could also say, [folk art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_art) 
for the 21st century: [widgets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget),
[gadgets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadget),
or [whirligigs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirligig)

### Audience

For people who appreciate art, or make things, or are interested in technology.

[Components]({% link ComponentTechnology.md %})

### About the web site (colophon)

- low-tech, maintained by the author

- static (no dynamically created pages) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

- hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

- open source, publicly viewable [source code](https://github.com/bootchk/solabile)

- edited and debugged locally (not on-line) in a web server in a [vagga](https://vagga.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) container.
Install only vagga, and then use the vagga.yaml script in the repository.
You do need to learn Jekyll and git.
When you edit your page source, it magically appears in your browser.
Then push it to Github, and it magically appears on the web.
