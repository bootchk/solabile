# Vagga script to build a github-pages website locally, in a userspace container

# Requirements of the host machine:
# vagga installed (see web)
# uidmap installed
#     >sudo apt-get install uidmap

# One container.
# You can delete the container by >rm -rf .vagga
# You don't need to be superuser, and you shouldn't do that anyway

# Goal of this script:
# 1) Delegate to vagga all worries about dependencies github-pages gem > jekyll > ruby
# 2) Not worry about any versions (if something is not compatible with github-pages, then start worrying.)
# 3) Not use bundler, which is just another thing to worry about

# In other words, you need to learn a tiny bit about vagga and jekyll and github-pages, but not ruby or bundler

# /work refers to the directory where this vagga.yaml file lives
# i.e. the "project" directory.
# It also contains many hidden files (.vagga is the container itself)
# The website source is in solabile (the name of my project)

# The workflow is:
# >cd ~/solabile (the project directory, not its subdirectory containing website source)
# >vagga buildWebsite
# In another window open browser on served website at url https://localhost:4000
# Enter cntl-C to quit the website server
# Make changes to website source and repeat >vagga buildWebsite
# >git commit        (or a variant, you need to know some basic git also)
# >git push main origin (to push it to github, which in a half hour will publish publically (jekyll serve it)

# I am not sure if vagga reads the GemFile, or only Jekyll
# Anyway, it specifies the Jekyll themes and plugins

containers:

  # basic OS with dev (compiling)
  baseOS:
    setup:
    
    # 20.4 LTS is 'focal'
    # 20.10 groovy
    - !Ubuntu groovy

    # enable universe repository
    - !UbuntuUniverse
    - !GemInstall [jekyll]
    - !GemInstall [github-pages]

    # Set env HOME to a directory in the project
    environ:
      HOME: /work/.home


# bundle exec jekyll serve works better than jekyll serve ???

commands:
  
  buildWebsite: !Command
    description: Build website using jekyll, and start server.  Navigate browser to https://localhost:4000
    container: baseOS
    run: |
      bundle exec jekyll serve
